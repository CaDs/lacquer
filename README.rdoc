= lacquer

Rails drop in for Varnish support.

== Install
Basic installation

  sudo gem install lacquer

config/initializers/lacquer.rb

  Lacquer.configure do |config|
    # Globally enable/disable cache
    config.enable_cache = true

    # Unless overridden in a controller or action, the default will be used
    config.default_ttl = 1.week

    # Can be :none, :delayed_job, :resque
    config.job_backend = :none

    # Array of Varnish servers to manage
    config.varnish_servers << {
      :host => "0.0.0.0", :port => 6082
    }

    # Number of retries
    config.retries = 5

    # config handler (optional, if you use Hoptoad or another error tracking service)
    config.command_error_handler = lambda { |s| HoptoadNotifier.notify(s) }
  end

app/controllers/application_controller.rb

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    include Lacquer::CacheUtils
  end

== Usage

To set a custom ttl for a controller:

  before_filter { |controller| controller.set_cache_ttl(15.minutes) }

Clearing the cache:

  class Posts < ApplicationController
    after_filter :clear_cache, :only => [ :create, :update, :destroy ]

  private

    def clear_cache
      clear_cache_for(
        root_path,
        posts_path,
        post_path(@post))
    end
  end

== Gotchas

The default TTL for most actions is set to 0, since for most cases you'll probably want to be fairly explicit about what pages do get cached by varnish. The default cache header is typically

  Cache-Control: max-age=0, no-cache, private

This is good for normal controller actions, since you won't want to cache them. If TTL for an action is set to 0, it won't mess with the default header. 

The key gotcha here is that cached pages strip cookies, so if your application relies on sessions and uses authenticity tokens, the user will need a session cookie set before form actions will work. Setting default TTL to 0 here will make sure these session cookies won't break.

As a result, all you have to do to set a cacheable action is the before filter above. 

== VCL config

  # -e This is a basic VCL configuration file for varnish.  See the vcl(7)
  # man page for details on VCL syntax and semantics.

  # Default backend definition.  Set this to point to your content #server.
  backend default {
    .host = "127.0.0.1";
    .port = "8282";
  }

  # Handling of requests that are received from clients.
  # First decide whether or not to lookup data in the cache.
  sub vcl_recv {
    # Pipe requests that are non-RFC2616 or CONNECT which is weird.
    if (req.request != "GET" &&
        req.request != "HEAD" &&
        req.request != "PUT" &&
        req.request != "POST" &&
        req.request != "TRACE" &&
        req.request != "OPTIONS" &&
        req.request != "DELETE") {
      return(pipe);
    }

    # Pass requests that are not GET or HEAD
    if (req.request != "GET" && req.request != "HEAD") {
      return(pass);
    }

    # Pass requests that we know we aren't caching
    if (req.url ~ "^/admin") {
      return(pass);
    }

    #
    # Everything below here should be cached
    #

    # Handle compression correctly. Varnish treats headers literally, not
    # semantically. So it is very well possible that there are cache misses
    # because the headers sent by different browsers aren't the same.
    # @see: http://varnish.projects.linpro.no/wiki/FAQ/Compression
    if (req.http.Accept-Encoding) {
      if (req.http.Accept-Encoding ~ "gzip") {
        # if the browser supports it, we'll use gzip
        set req.http.Accept-Encoding = "gzip";
      } elsif (req.http.Accept-Encoding ~ "deflate") {
        # next, try deflate if it is supported
        set req.http.Accept-Encoding = "deflate";
      } else {
        # unknown algorithm. Probably junk, remove it
        remove req.http.Accept-Encoding;
      }
    }

    # Clear cookie and authorization headers, set grace time, lookup in the cache
    # unset req.http.Cookie;
    # unset req.http.Authorization;
    set req.grace = 1s;
    return(lookup);
  }

  # Called when entering pipe mode
  sub vcl_pipe {
    # If we don't set the Connection: close header, any following
    # requests from the client will also be piped through and
    # left untouched by varnish. We don't want that.
    set req.http.connection = "close";
    return(pipe);
  }


  # Called when the requested object has been retrieved from the
  # backend, or the request to the backend has failed
  sub vcl_fetch {
    # Do not cache the object if the backend application does not want us to.
    if (obj.http.Cache-Control ~ "(no-cache|no-store|private|must-revalidate)") {
      pass;
    }

    # Do not cache the object if the status is not in the 200s
    if (obj.status >= 300) {
      # Remove the Set-Cookie header
      remove obj.http.Set-Cookie;
      return(pass);
    }

    # Everything below here should be cached

    # Remove the Set-Cookie header
    remove obj.http.Set-Cookie;

    # Set the grace time
    set obj.grace = 1s;

    # Deliver the object
    deliver;
  }

  sub vcl_deliver {
    # Force browsers and intermediary caches to always check back with us
    # set resp.http.Cache-Control = "private, max-age=0, must-revalidate";
    # set resp.http.Pragma = "no-cache";

    if (obj.hits > 0) {
      set resp.http.X-Cache = "HIT";

  }


== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

  * Fork the project.
  * Make your feature addition or bug fix.
  * Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
  * Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
  * Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
