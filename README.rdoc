= lacquer

Rails drop in for Varnish support.

== Install
Basic installation

  rails generate lacquer install

config/initializers/lacquer.rb

  Lacquer.configure do |config|
    # Globally enable/disable cache
    config.enable_cache = true
  
    # Unless overridden in a controller or action, the default will be used
    config.default_ttl = 1.week
  
    # Can be :none, :delayed_job, :resque
    config.job_backend = :none
  
    # Array of Varnish servers to manage
    config.varnish_servers << { 
      :host => '0.0.0.0', :port => 6082
    }
  end
  
app/controllers/application_controller.rb

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    include Lacquer::CacheUtils
  end

== Usage
To set a custom ttl for a controller:

  before_filter { |controller| controller.set_cache_ttl(15.minutes) }

Clearing the cache:

  class Posts < ApplicationController
    after_filter :clear_cache, :only => [ :create, :update, :destroy ]

  private

    def clear_cache
      clear_cache_for(
        root_path,
        posts_path,
        post_path(@post))
    end
  end

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
